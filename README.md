# typescript-react-template

Boilerplate for a React project with Typescript. This is mostly as a reminder for me to use on various aspects of configuration.

## Overview

The project uses webpack. A Jest test setup is included.

### Usage

`npm start` - Run the development environment<br>
`npm run build` - Build the project with webpack to be output to dist<br>
`npm test` - Run the tests
